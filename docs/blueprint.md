## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Pale pink (#FADADD) to align with the elegant aesthetic, softened for UI use.  The color pale pink has connotations of tenderness, nurturance and delicateness.
- Background color: Very light pink (#F9F0F1) for the light theme and dark gray (#222222) for the dark theme.  These choices of light and dark are in keeping with the delicate feel of the overall aesthetic.
- Accent color: Slightly darker pink (#F5B7C4) to provide contrast for interactive elements.
- Font: 'Vazirmatn' (sans-serif) to ensure excellent support for both Persian and English characters. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use icons exclusively from the lucide-react library, simple and modern to match 'Setareh' (star) theme.
- Implement a fully responsive design with Right-to-Left (RTL) layout for optimal viewing on all devices.
- Subtle animations (e.g., fade-in effects) to enhance the user experience when transitioning between pages or loading content.
